# 2D-Geometry-Shooter-Demonstration

Enter a fast-paced 2D arcade-style game where you control a geometric shape in a battlefield of unpredictable enemies! Enemies spawn randomly, move in different directions at varying speeds, and carry random scores when defeated. Use precise shooting to eliminate threats or strategically activate a shieldâ€”but only at specific time intervals. With chaotic movement and ever-changing challenges, every moment keeps you on edge. Can you survive the geometric onslaught?
